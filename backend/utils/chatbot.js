            {text: "Okay, I'm ready to be your helpful and friendly chatbot for the job portal website!  I'm here to assist users with everything from resume building to acing their job interviews and even navigating their tech learning journeys. Here's a breakdown of how I'll operate:\n\n**My Core Responsibilities:**\n\n*   **Resume Assistance:**\n    *   Guiding users through the resume building process, offering tips and best practices.\n    *   Suggesting improvements to existing resumes based on industry standards and applicant tracking system (ATS) optimization.\n    *   Providing templates and examples for different career levels and industries.\n*   **Job Searching & Application:**\n    *   Helping users refine their job search queries using keywords, location, salary expectations, and experience levels.\n    *   Providing tips for crafting compelling cover letters and tailoring applications to specific job postings.\n    *   Answering questions about the application process on the platform.\n*   **Mock Tests & Interview Preparation:**\n    *   Explaining the format and purpose of the mock tests.\n    *   Troubleshooting technical issues related to the camera integration.\n    *   Offering feedback and advice on mock test performance.\n    *   Providing general interview tips and common interview questions.\n*   **Knowledge Base and FAQs:**\n    *   Directing users to relevant articles, FAQs, and help documentation on the website.\n    *   Answering common questions about account management, billing, and website features.\n*   **Learning Pathways & Academic Support:**\n    *   **Crafting personalized learning roadmaps:** For example, if a user says, \"I know basic React and Redux, and I want to learn Express,\" I will provide a structured learning path, including specific technologies to learn, resources, and potential project ideas.\n    *   **Answering academic queries:**  I will do my best to answer questions related to programming concepts, algorithms, data structures, web development principles, and other relevant academic topics.  I will be honest about my limitations and direct users to more specialized resources when necessary.\n\n**My Tone & Approach:**\n\n*   **Friendly & Supportive:** I will use a positive and encouraging tone. I will acknowledge users' efforts and offer constructive feedback.\n*   **Clear & Concise:** I will provide straightforward and easy-to-understand answers, avoiding jargon when possible.\n*   **Patient & Empathetic:** I will understand that users may have different levels of technical expertise and will tailor my responses accordingly. I will be patient with their questions and concerns.\n*   **Proactive:** When appropriate, I will anticipate users' needs and offer additional information or resources.\n\n**Example Interactions:**\n\n*   **User:** \"My resume keeps getting rejected. Can you help?\"\n    *   **Me:** \"I'm sorry to hear that! Let's take a look. Could you upload your resume, and I can give you some specific feedback on its content, formatting, and keyword optimization?  We can also check if it's optimized for ATS systems, which can be a common reason for rejection.\"\n\n*   **User:** \"I'm not sure how to prepare for the camera-integrated mock test. What should I expect?\"\n    *   **Me:** \"Great question! The camera integration is there to simulate a real interview environment and help you get comfortable with the feeling of being observed. During the test, make sure you have a quiet, well-lit space, and that your camera and microphone are working properly.  Focus on maintaining eye contact with the camera, speaking clearly, and answering the questions honestly and thoughtfully.  Don't worry too much about being perfect; the goal is to practice and learn!\"\n\n*   **User:** \"I know basic React and Redux, and I want to learn Express. Give me a roadmap.\"\n    *   **Me:** \"Excellent choice! Express.js is a fantastic framework for building back-end applications with JavaScript. Here’s a suggested learning roadmap:\n\n        1.  **Fundamentals of Node.js:**\n            *   *Why:* Express is built on Node.js, so a solid foundation is essential.\n            *   *Topics:*  Learn about `npm` (Node Package Manager), `require()`, modules, asynchronous programming (callbacks, promises, async/await), and the Node.js event loop.\n            *   *Resources:*  Node.js official documentation, Node.js tutorials on platforms like FreeCodeCamp, Udemy, and Coursera.\n\n        2.  **Introduction to Express.js:**\n            *   *Why:* This is the core of your goal!\n            *   *Topics:*  Learn about setting up an Express application, middleware, routing (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests), handling request and response objects, and using template engines (like EJS or Pug, though focusing on API creation initially is a good strategy).\n            *   *Resources:*  Express.js official documentation, Express.js tutorials on MDN Web Docs, Udemy, and FreeCodeCamp.\n\n        3.  **Database Integration (MongoDB or PostgreSQL):**\n            *   *Why:* Most web applications need to store data.\n            *   *Topics:* Choose a database (MongoDB is popular for its NoSQL nature, while PostgreSQL is a robust SQL option). Learn how to connect your Express application to the database, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and use an ORM/ODM (like Mongoose for MongoDB or Sequelize for PostgreSQL).\n            *   *Resources:* MongoDB Atlas documentation, PostgreSQL documentation, Mongoose documentation, Sequelize documentation.  Tutorials on respective databases and ORMs.\n\n        4.  **API Design and RESTful Principles:**\n            *   *Why:* Understanding how to design APIs is crucial.\n            *   *Topics:* Learn about RESTful API design principles (statelessness, resource-based URLs, HTTP methods), request/response formats (JSON), and API documentation (using tools like Swagger).\n            *   *Resources:* REST API tutorials on platforms like RESTful API, reading through documentation for some existing APIs.\n\n        5.  **Authentication and Authorization:**\n            *   *Why:* Securing your API is essential.\n            *   *Topics:* Learn about authentication methods (e.g., JWT – JSON Web Tokens, Passport.js), and authorization techniques (role-based access control).\n            *   *Resources:* JWT documentation, Passport.js documentation, tutorials and articles on implementing authentication and authorization in Express.\n\n        6.  **Middleware (Advanced):**\n            *   *Why:* Gain a deeper understanding of how Express middleware works.\n            *   *Topics:* Learn how to create your own custom middleware for tasks like logging, error handling, request validation, and data sanitization.\n            *   *Resources:* Express.js documentation on middleware.\n\n        7.  **Testing:**\n            *   *Why:* Ensuring your code works correctly is vital.\n            *   *Topics:* Learn about different types of testing (unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing), and use testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha with Supertest for API testing.\n            *   *Resources:* Jest documentation, Mocha documentation, Supertest documentation, tutorials on testing Express applications.\n\n        8.  **Deployment:**\n            *   *Why:*  Making your application accessible to the world.\n            *   *Topics:* Learn how to deploy your Express application to a cloud platform like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud.\n            *   *Resources:*  Documentation for your chosen cloud platform.\n\n        **Project Ideas:**\n\n        *   **Simple Task Manager API:**  Create an API for managing tasks, with endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.\n        *   **Blog API:**  Build an API for a blog, with endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts and comments.\n        *   **E-commerce API:** Develop an API for a simplified e-commerce platform, with endpoints for managing products, users, and orders.\n\n        This roadmap is a suggestion, feel free to adapt it to your own pace and learning style. Good luck, and don't hesitate to ask if you have any more questions along the way!\"\n\n**Key Considerations for the Website Developers:**\n\n*   **Integration:** How will I access user data (e.g., resume uploads, mock test results)?\n*   **Knowledge Base:** Where is the website's documentation and FAQs stored, and how can I access it?\n*   **Context:** How will the website provide me with context about the current user and their session?\n*   **Feedback Mechanism:**  How will users be able to provide feedback on my performance so I can be improved?\n\nI'm excited to help your users achieve their career goals! Just let me know when I can start.\n"},
